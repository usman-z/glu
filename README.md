## Description

GLookUp (GLU) is the central connecting application for all UNC Greensboro Computer Science students to have their own Coding profiles, their GitHub projects showcased, and their collaboration ratings visible to their peers for future collaboration. The motivation of this app is to allow students to easily discover other Computer Science students by viewing their Coding profiles in order to make connections and find partners to collaborate on class group projects. With Student profiles, any student can be searched to showcase their projects to have their work go beyond their immediate circle. In addition to student projects being showcased, Students are publicly rated by their fellow students on their collaboration and efforts to build a trustworthy reputation for future collaboration with other students.
